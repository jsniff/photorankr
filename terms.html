In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Photorankr Service.<br />
<br />You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.  Photorankr is not responsible for how said transmissions can effect your Content.<br />
<br />3. Registration Obligations<br />
<br />When and if you set up your Photorankr account and upload photos (which constitutes agreement to use the Service in accordance with these Terms), you agree to (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as prompted by our registration form (including your email address), and (b) maintain and update your information (including your email address) to keep it accurate, current, and complete.

<br />As part of the account set-up and registration process, you may be asked to select a username and password. We may refuse to grant you a username for any reason in our sole discretion, including in the event that we determine that such user name impersonates someone else, is illegal, vulgar, or otherwise offensive, or is protected by trademark or other proprietary rights law, or otherwise may cause confusion. You will be responsible for the confidentiality and use of your username and password and agree not to transfer or resell your use of or access to the Service to any third party.

You acknowledge, consent and agree that PhotoRankr may access, preserve and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; or (iv) protect the rights, property or personal safety of PhotoRankr its users and the public.  PhotoRankr reserves the right to use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the site, to deliver editorial content, and to record registration and personalization information.

<br />6. Member Submissions<br />
<br />In the event that you post or upload to the Service, or otherwise submit to or through PhotoRankr as part of your use of the Service, any materials including, without limitation, photographs and other images, text, data, files, links and other materials (collectively, &ldquo;Submissions&rdquo;), you will retain ownership of such Submissions, and you hereby grant us and our designees a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicenseable (through multiple tiers), assignable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable right to use, reproduce, distribute (through multiple tiers), create derivative works of, and publicly display and perform (publicly or otherwise) such Submissions, solely in connection with the Service (including without limitation for purposes of promoting the Service). Please note that, while you retain ownership of your Submissions, any template or layout in which you arrange or organize such Submissions through tools and features made available through PhotoRankr are not proprietary to you, and can be used by PhotoRankr and others for any purposes. You acknowledge and agree that you have no rights in any such template and/or layout, and such template or layout shall be the sole and exclusive property of PhotoRankr. <br />
<br />You represent, warrant and covenant that (i) you own or otherwise possess all necessary rights with respect to your Submissions, (ii) your Submissions do not and will not infringe, misappropriate, use or disclose without authorization, or otherwise violate any intellectual property or proprietary right of any third party, and are not unlawful, fraudulent, threatening, abusive, libelous, defamatory, obscene or otherwise objectionable, and (iii) you hereby consent to the use of your likeness, and you have obtained the written consent, release, and/or permission of every identifiable individual who appears in a Submission to use such individual's likeness, for purposes of using and otherwise exploiting the Submission in the manner contemplated by these Terms (including for purposes of promoting the Service), or, if any such identifiable individual is under the age of eighteen (18), you have obtained such written consent, release and/or permission from such individual's parent or guardian (and you agree to provide to PhotoRankr a copy of any such consents, releases and/or permissions upon PhotoRankr's request).

<br />Please note that we may also provide users with an automated method of reporting Submissions that they believe to be inappropriate. If we do provide such a method, Submissions that are reported more than a certain number of times may be automatically removed from the Service; provided, however, that PhotoRankr has no obligation to remove Submissions in response to user reports or requests. PhotoRankr is not responsible for, and will have no liability for, the removal or non-removal of any Submissions from the Service.

<br />7. Forums<br />
<br />The Service may permit users to share their Submissions with other users, including but not limited to our user comment functionality and our public gallery (collectively, &ldquo;Forums&rdquo;). Some Forum participants may use anonymous screen names and may have no other connection with PhotoRankr. A large volume of material is available in our Forums and Forum participants may occasionally post messages or make statements, whether intentionally or unintentionally, that are inaccurate, misleading or deceptive, and provide content that may be objectionable to you. We neither endorse nor are responsible for such messages, statements, or content, or any opinion, advice, information or other utterance made or displayed on the Service by third parties, whether such third parties are users of the Service or others. The opinions expressed in the Forums reflect solely the opinions of the participants and may not reflect the opinions of PhotoRankr. We are not responsible for any errors or omissions in postings, for hyperlinks embedded in messages or for any results obtained from the use of such information. Under no circumstances will PhotoRankr, any of our affiliates, distributors, partners, licensors, advertisers or sponsors, and/or any of our or their directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents or other representatives be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on such information obtained through the Service. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor the Forums and any materials displayed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through the Forums or otherwise through the Service. <br />
<br />You acknowledge and agree that PhotoRankr has no responsibility or liability for any transmissions, and/or any content included in such transmissions, sent or received by you. PhotoRankr reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at any time, to set limits on the number and size of any transmissions sent by or received through the Service and/or the amount of storage space available for transmissions or for any feature made available through the Service.<br />
<br />8. Making Purchases<br />
<br />If you wish to purchase any products or services through the Service, we will ask you to utilize PayPal. You agree to comply with all of PayPal's <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/terms-outside">Terms & Conditions</a>.

<br />Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, price and availability of any products or services are subject to change without notice, and our current prices can be found on the Service. We make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Service at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased through the Service. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.

<br />8. Copyright Issues<br />
<br />PhotoRankr is committed to protecting copyrights and expects users of the Service to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the &ldquo;DMCA&rdquo;) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that any material used or displayed on or through the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the Service; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.copyright.gov/ for details. DMCA notices and counter-notices regarding the Service should be sent to: <br />
